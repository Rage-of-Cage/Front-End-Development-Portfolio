  <h2>My Hobbies and Activities</h2>
  <p>
    During my life I have picked up many hobbies along the way.
    These contain anything from playing videos games, drawing hyper realistic animals in charcoal,
    or even competing in triathalons. My passions keep me coming back for knowledge
    of how I can make changes in my life, and either create or do wonderful things.
    Those interests stem from a creative background of learning music and art under and acedemic lens.
    It has allowed me to collect so many practicle, niche, and unique skills. This of course applies
    to my studies. From philosophy, computer science, history, art medium techniques, to delicious cooking.
    My curiosity for all that we can achieve has led me down these avenues, and there will be many more to come.
