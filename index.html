<h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    My career into web development has just started as is evident with a pure html resume. 
    However this was all gained in a matter of a few hours of work, understanding, practicing, and testing.
    My skills go far beyond what is shown, and continues to grow everyday.
    Please follow along on my progress in further projects posted on my github repository.
    If you have any questions or interest in my abilities, and how I can be a good fit for you, do not hesitate to reach out.
